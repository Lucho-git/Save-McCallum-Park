        <p class="text-center">
            McCallum Park is more than just a basketball court; it's a hub of incredible culture and community. Many people, after a long day at work, arrive at the park around 5:30-6:00 PM to enjoy a game of basketball with friends and fellow enthusiasts. However, the recent changes to the park's lighting schedule have dealt a significant blow to this vibrant community.

            The lights at McCallum Park now turn off at 7:30 PM, a drastic change from the previous times of 8:30 PM and 9:30 PM. This early shutdown leaves the basketball community with less than 2 hours of playtime, severely limiting their ability to enjoy the sport they love and connect with others.
